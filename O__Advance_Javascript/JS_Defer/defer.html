    <!-- The defer attribute allows the scripts to be executed in the proper order
    without blocking the parsing of the HTML document. This can be useful when
    you have scripts that depend on the DOM (Document Object Model) being fully
    loaded or when you want to ensure that scripts don't block rendering. -->
